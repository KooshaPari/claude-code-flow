```bash
# Deploy to Kubernetes cluster
kubectl apply -f k8s/claude-flow-deployment.yaml

# Features included:
# - Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (3-10 replicas)
# - Persistent storage for data
# - Load balancer with ingress
# - Pod disruption budgets
# - Resource limits and requests
```

### 3. Manual Production Setup

```bash
# Build production image
docker build -f Dockerfile.production -t claude-flow:production .

# Run production startup script
./scripts/production/start-production.sh
```

## üìä Monitoring & Alerting

### Health Check Endpoints
- `GET /health` - Comprehensive health status
- `GET /metrics` - Prometheus metrics
- `GET /api/mcp/health` - MCP service health

### Grafana Dashboards
- **System Metrics**: CPU, memory, disk usage
- **Application Metrics**: Request rate, response time, error rate
- **Business Metrics**: Swarms created, agents spawned, tasks completed
- **Performance Metrics**: Token usage, cache hit rate, database performance

### Alerting Rules
- Service availability monitoring
- High error rate detection
- Resource utilization alerts
- Performance degradation warnings

## üîí Security Features

### Container Security
- Non-root user execution (UID 1001)
- Minimal base image (Alpine Linux)
- Security scanning with vulnerability assessment
- Resource limits and security contexts

### Data Protection
- Encrypted backups with AES-256
- Secure secret management
- Network isolation with Docker networks
- HTTPS/TLS termination at load balancer

### Access Control
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- API rate limiting
- CORS configuration
- Audit logging

## üíæ Backup & Disaster Recovery

### Automated Backup System
```bash
# Daily automated backups
./scripts/production/backup.sh

# Features:
# - Database backups with WAL mode
# - Configuration and state backups
# - Encrypted storage
# - Cloud sync to S3
# - Integrity verification
```

### Backup Strategy
- **RTO**: 4 hours (Recovery Time Objective)
- **RPO**: 15 minutes (Recovery Point Objective)
- **Retention**: 30 days local, 12 months cloud
- **Encryption**: AES-256 with AWS KMS

### Disaster Recovery Scenarios
- Data corruption detection and recovery
- Hardware failure failover
- Datacenter outage procedures
- Cyber attack isolation and restore

## üîß Configuration Management

### Production Configuration
```json
{
  "environment": "production",
  "server": {
    "host": "0.0.0.0",
    "port": 8080,
    "workers": 4
  },
  "logging": {
    "level": "info",
    "format": "json"
  },
  "metrics": {
    "enabled": true
  },
  "security": {
    "rate_limit": {
      "enabled": true,
      "requests_per_minute": 100
    }
  }
}
```

### Environment Variables
- `CLAUDE_FLOW_ENV=production`
- `RUST_LOG=info`
- `CLAUDE_FLOW_CONFIG_DIR=/app/config`
- `CLAUDE_FLOW_DATA_DIR=/app/data`

## üìà Performance Optimization

### Resource Requirements
- **Minimum**: 512MB RAM, 1 CPU core, 10GB storage
- **Recommended**: 2GB RAM, 2 CPU cores, 50GB storage
- **High Load**: 4GB RAM, 4 CPU cores, 100GB storage

### Scaling Guidelines
- **Horizontal**: Use Kubernetes HPA for auto-scaling
- **Vertical**: Monitor metrics and adjust resource limits
- **Database**: Consider PostgreSQL for high-volume deployments
- **Caching**: Redis for session and query caching
