# Claude-Flow MCP Server: LLM-to-LLM Delegation

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables LLMs to delegate complex tasks to Claude-Flow as if it were a subordinate LLM with specialized multi-agent capabilities.

## Overview

This MCP server transforms Claude-Flow into a **subordinate LLM** that your primary LLM can delegate work to. Instead of managing individual agents and tasks, you interact with Claude-Flow as a capable assistant that can:

- **Accept complex task delegations** with natural language descriptions
- **Automatically break down work** into subtasks and coordinate specialized agents
- **Provide progress updates** and accept guidance during execution
- **Deliver structured results** when work is complete
- **Maintain context** across multiple related tasks

Think of it as having a **project manager LLM** with a team of specialists at its disposal.

## Key Delegation Patterns

### ðŸŽ¯ **Task Delegation**
```
You: "I need market research on AI development trends in 2024"
Claude-Flow: *spawns researcher agents, coordinates data gathering, provides structured report*
```

### ðŸ”„ **Progress Monitoring**
```
You: "How's that research project going?"
Claude-Flow: *provides detailed progress, agent activities, preliminary findings*
```

### ðŸ’¬ **Interactive Guidance**
```
You: "Focus more on enterprise AI adoption rates"
Claude-Flow: *adjusts research focus, reallocates agent priorities*
```

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ 
- Claude-Flow installed and accessible via CLI
- MCP-compatible client (Claude Desktop, etc.)

### Setup

1. **Install the MCP server:**
```bash
npm install -g claude-flow-mcp-server
```

2. **Or clone and install locally:**
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd claude-flow-mcp-server
npm install
```

3. **Ensure Claude-Flow is available:**
```bash
npx claude-flow --help
```

## Configuration

### MCP Client Configuration

- Analyze the task and determine the best approach
- Spawn appropriate specialized agents (researchers, implementers, analysts, etc.)
- Coordinate the work and manage dependencies
- Store context and maintain progress

**Parameters:**

  ],
  context: "We're developing an AI project management tool and need comprehensive market intelligence to inform our product strategy and go-to-market approach"
});

console.log("Task delegated:", delegation.task_info);
console.log("Next steps:", delegation.next_steps);

// 4. Monitor progress periodically
const progress = await callTool('check_claude_flow_progress', {

  include_details: true
});

console.log("Current progress:", progress.progress_summary);

// 5. Provide additional guidance if needed
await callTool('ask_claude_flow_question', {
  question: "Please prioritize tools that have raised significant funding in the last 2 years, as these are likely our most serious competitors",
  context_task_id: delegation.task_info.id,
  urgency: "normal"
});

// 6. Give specific instructions for course correction
await callTool('instruct_claude_flow', {

// 7. Retrieve final results when complete
const results = await callTool('retrieve_claude_flow_results', {
  task_id: delegation.task_info.id,
  format: "detailed",
  include_artifacts: true
});

console.log("Final deliverables:", results.deliverables);
```

### ðŸ”„ **Multi-Phase Project Delegation**

```javascript
// Phase 1: Research
const research = await callTool('delegate_to_claude_flow', {
  task_description: "Research user authentication best practices and security standards for web applications",
  task_type: "research",
  priority: 9,
  expected_deliverables: ["Security requirements document", "Best practices guide", "Technology recommendations"]
});

// Phase 2: Implementation (after research is complete)
const implementation = await callTool('delegate_to_claude_flow', {
  task_description: "Implement secure user authentication system based on research findings",
  task_type: "implementation",
  priority: 9,
  requirements: ["Use research findings as specification", "Include multi-factor authentication", "Follow OWASP guidelines"],
  context: `Build upon the research completed in task ${research.task_info.id}`
});

// Phase 3: Review and Testing
const review = await callTool('delegate_to_claude_flow', {
  task_description: "Review and test the implemented authentication system for security vulnerabilities",
  task_type: "review",
  priority: 8,
  requirements: ["Security audit", "Penetration testing", "Code review"],
  context: `Review the implementation from task ${implementation.task_info.id}`
});
```

### ðŸ’¬ **Interactive Collaboration**

```javascript
// Start a complex analysis task
const analysis = await callTool('delegate_to_claude_flow', {
  task_description: "Analyze our application's performance bottlenecks and recommend optimization strategies",
  task_type: "analysis",
  priority: 7
});

// Check progress and provide feedback
const progress = await callTool('check_claude_flow_progress', {
  task_id: analysis.task_info.id
});

// Ask for clarification
await callTool('ask_claude_flow_question', {
  question: "Are you finding any database-related bottlenecks? We've been seeing slow query performance on the user dashboard.",
  context_task_id: analysis.task_info.id,
  urgency: "high"
});

// Provide additional context
await callTool('instruct_claude_flow', {
  instruction: "Please also consider our recent migration to microservices - some performance issues might be related to inter-service communication overhead.",
  task_id: analysis.task_info.id,
  instruction_type: "clarification"
});
```

## Error Handling

The server provides structured error responses with:
- Success/failure status
- Error messages and codes
- Command output and stderr
- Exit codes from CLI commands

## Security Considerations

- Commands are executed in isolated processes
- Output size is limited to prevent memory issues
- Timeouts prevent hanging processes
- Only whitelisted commands are allowed
- Environment variables control access

## Development

### Running in Development Mode
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Testing
```bash
npm test
```

### Debugging
Set `CLAUDE_FLOW_LOG_LEVEL=debug` for detailed logging.
