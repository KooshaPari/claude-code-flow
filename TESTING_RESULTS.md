## Deployment Recommendations

1. **Immediate Use**: The system is ready for production deployment
2. **Security**: Enable QuDAG for sensitive communications
3. **Monitoring**: Use lifecycle management for agent health monitoring
4. **Scaling**: Start with 2-3 hierarchical levels and expand as needed
5. **Documentation**: Reference the comprehensive examples for implementation patterns

## Conclusion

The hierarchical agent system successfully implements the requested functionality:

> "Allow TASK() agents to be able to spawn their own TASK() agents, we want to effectively allow the creation of a full org-like scaffold of communicating and working agents"

All core requirements have been met:
- âœ… TASK() agents can spawn sub-agents
- âœ… Full organizational scaffolds can be created
- âœ… Agents communicate and coordinate effectively
- âœ… Enhanced with quantum-resistant security
- âœ… Production-ready with comprehensive examples

**Status**: ðŸŸ¢ **READY FOR PRODUCTION USE**
