Working with Claude-Flow agents

Overview:
──────────────
Agents are the core workers in Claude-Flow. Each agent has:
• A unique ID (automatically generated)
• A name (for easy identification)
• A type (coordinator, researcher, implementer, analyst, custom)
• Capabilities (what the agent can do)
• A system prompt (instructions for the agent)

Use --tutorial for complete tutorial.

Common Examples:
──────────────
  claude-flow agent spawn researcher --name "Research Assistant"
    Spawn a research agent

  claude-flow agent list
    List all active agents

  claude-flow agent info agent-001
    Get detailed agent information

... and 2 more

Use --examples for all examples.
